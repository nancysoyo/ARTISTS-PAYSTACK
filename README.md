# ARTISTS-PAYSTACK

The index.php is the home page and has all artists.

When the Fans click on a product to pay, they pay in the creator's account and the platform receives 2 percent of the payment.

Fans get redirected to the page where they have access to the payment once the payment is done.

Logging into my PayStack account, you can see the money sent to the respective account.
